We all love Google Lens. It’s magic. You point your camera at a flower, and it tells you the species. You point it at a dog, it tells you the breed.

But have you ever tried to use it to **buy something**?

Usually, it gives you:
1.  A random eBay listing from 2018.
2.  A Pinterest photo with no link.
3.  An expensive Amazon listing with a 300% markup.

## The Problem: "Visual Search" vs. "Price Search"

Google Lens is a **Generalist**. It is trying to identify *everything* in the world. It doesn't care about saving you money; it just wants to match the pixels.

Wino is a **Specialist**. It only cares about one thing: **"Where is the factory source of this product?"**

## The Showdown

We took a viral "Levitating Moon Lamp" and scanned it with both apps.

### Round 1: Google Lens
*   **Result:** Found it on Amazon, Wayfair, and a suspicious dropshipping site called "MoonVibes.com".
*   **Lowest Price Found:** $89.00.
*   **Experience:** Cluttered. Too many options. No coupons.

### Round 2: Wino App
*   **Result:** Identified the exact SKU on Temu and AliExpress.
*   **Lowest Price Found:** $18.50.
*   **Experience:** One tap. Direct link. 30% Coupon applied automatically.

## Why Wino Wins for Shoppers

If you are a botanist, keep using Google Lens. But if you are trying to decorate your room or find a gift?

1.  **The "Coupon Injection":** Wino doesn't just find the link; it copies a discount code to your clipboard before you open the store. Google doesn't do that.
2.  **The "Wishlist":** Google Lens has no memory. Wino saves every scan to your history so you can build a shopping list.
3.  **The "Deep Link":** We link directly to the app (Temu/AliExpress) so the tracking works and the prices are accurate.

## Final Verdict

**Google Lens** is for *identifying* things (Plants, monuments, translations).
**Wino** is for *buying* things (Gadgets, decor, fashion).

Stop paying the "Lazy Tax" by clicking the first Amazon link Google shows you. Scan it properly. Save the money.
