If you are trying to find viral products—whether for dropshipping or just for your own shopping—you have probably run into a wall of expensive software.

Tools like **Minea**, **Pipiads**, and **AdSpy** are powerful, but they are built for "Enterprise" users with big budgets. They cost anywhere from **$99 to $300 per month**.

But what if you just want to scan a video on your phone and find the supplier? You shouldn't need a corporate subscription for that.

We ranked the **Top 5 Product Finders** available right now, from expensive pros to free hacks.

## 1. Wino App (Best Free Mobile Tool)
**Price:** Free
**Best For:** Mobile users, Shoppers, Beginners.

We built Wino because we hated switching to a desktop just to find a product. Wino lives inside your phone's "Share" menu.
*   **The Magic:** You don't search a database; you just "Share" a TikTok video to the app.
*   **The Result:** It finds the exact image on Temu/AliExpress instantly.
*   **The Bonus:** It auto-saves everything to a local Wishlist.

## 2. Minea (Best for Data Nerds)
**Price:** ~$99/month
**Best For:** Professional Dropshippers.

Minea is the "Gold Standard" for analyzing Facebook and TikTok ads. It gives you graphs, engagement data, and saturation levels.
*   **Pros:** Incredible data depth.
*   **Cons:** Extremely expensive. The interface is desktop-only and complex.

## 3. Pipiads (Best for Ads)
**Price:** ~$165/month
**Best For:** Finding viral ads before they blow up.

If you are running paid ads, Pipiads is great. It scrapes TikTok specifically for ad creatives.
*   **Pros:** Finds hidden ads you wouldn't see on your FYP.
*   **Cons:** The price tag is painful for anyone just starting out.

## 4. Google Lens (Best for Random Objects)
**Price:** Free
**Best For:** Identifying plants, landmarks, or translating text.

Google Lens is amazing technology, but it isn't designed for shopping.
*   **Pros:** It's built into Android.
*   **Cons:** It gives you random results (eBay, Pinterest, Stock Photos) rather than a direct link to buy the product cheaply. No coupon codes.

## 5. AliExpress Image Search (Best for Desktop)
**Price:** Free
**Best For:** People who shop on a laptop.

The native AliExpress image search is decent, but they hide it on the mobile app sometimes, and it requires you to save the screenshot first, open the app, and upload it manually.
*   **Pros:** Direct access to AliExpress.
*   **Cons:** Clunky workflow. Too many clicks.

## The Verdict

If you are a 7-figure business owner running massive ad campaigns, pay for **Minea**. It's worth the investment for the data.

But if you are a **Shopper**, a **Content Creator**, or just starting your product research journey?

**Use Wino.** It is faster, it lives on your phone, and it costs $0.

Why pay for data you don't need? Scan it, save it, buy it.
