We've all seen that viral Stanley Cup on TikTok. The one that keeps drinks icy for hours, survives car crashes, and looks sleek as hell.

But when you go to buy it, the price tag hits hard: **$45+ for the real deal.**

Meanwhile, dupes are popping up everywhere for under $10. So, what's the real difference?

## The Pain: Real Stanley Cup = Real Price

The authentic Stanley Cup isn't cheap. It's durable, well-made, and comes with a warranty. But if you just want the aesthetic and don't care about the logo, you're stuck paying a massive "Brand Tax."

And if you're scrolling TikTok, you're probably drowning in "likes" and lost videos—scrolling past dupes but never saving them.

## The Fix: Wino Finds the Factory Price

Here's where Wino saves your wallet.
1.  **Share** the TikTok video of the expensive cup to Wino.
2.  **Auto-Save** it to your wishlist so you don't lose it.
3.  **Reveal** the factory price from Temu or AliExpress.

We found the exact same **40oz Tumbler with Handle** (same stainless steel, same straw) on Temu for **$8.48**.

## The Verdict: Don't Get Scammed

The real Stanley Cup is great if you need a lifetime warranty. But the dupes look 99% identical and keep ice frozen for 12+ hours.

*   **Real:** $45.00
*   **Wino Find:** $8.48

**The Math:** You could buy 5 dupes in different colors for the price of one real one.

**Bottom line:** Save your TikTok finds, get the price reveal, and never overpay for a viral product again.
