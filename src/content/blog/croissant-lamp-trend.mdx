If you’ve opened TikTok in the last 48 hours, you’ve seen it.

It’s buttery. It’s flaky. It’s glowing warm amber light in a sad, beige room.

It is **The Croissant Lamp.**

We are officially living in the era of "dopamine decor," and nothing releases serotonin quite like a giant, glowing pastry on your nightstand. But there is a dark side to this carb-loaded aesthetic.

## The "Boutique" Markup Scam

Here is the tea.

Instagram boutiques and "aesthetic" dropshippers are currently gatekeeping this lamp like their lives depend on it. They are listing these bad boys for **$85, $90, and even $120**.

 They market it as "artisanal resin art" or "Parisian chic lighting."

Let’s be real for a second. It is a battery-operated piece of plastic that looks like a breakfast food. It is delightful, yes. But is it worth nearly a hundred dollars? Absolutely not. You are paying a "cool tax" because an influencer put it next to a frantic pile of unread books.

You want the vibes, but you don't want to burn your wallet.

## We Found the Source (And It’s $12)

Welcome to Wino. We reverse-searched the "artisanal" lamp and found the exact factory line.

Same resin mold. Same warm LED bulb. Same AAA battery compartment.

**Price on Wino: ~$12.**

That is literally cheaper than buying a real croissant and a coffee in New York City.

### Why is this thing viral?

It’s the "Carb-Core" movement. In 2025, we are tired of minimalism. We are tired of gray walls. We want our homes to look like a bakery exploded in the most cozy way possible.

*   **The Glow:** It emits a super warm, orange light (2700K for the nerds) that makes everyone look better on FaceTime.
*   **The absurd factor:** It’s a conversation starter. "Is that... bread?" Yes. Yes, it is.
*   **The Touch:** It actually feels like a hardened loaf of sourdough. (Please do not bite it. We tried. It hurt.)

## How to Style It (Without Looking Crazy)

### 1. The Nightstand Stack
Don't just put the lamp there. Stack it on top of a few coffee table books. It gives "I read, but I also enjoy carbs."

### 2. The Kitchen Counter
Mix it in with your real fruit bowl. Wait for a guest to try and grab it. Comedy gold.

## The Verdict

The Croissant Lamp is the stupidest, happiest purchase you will make this month. But for the love of gluten, do not pay $85 for it.

Grab it on the app, save your money, and maybe use the extra cash to buy, you know, actual bread.
