You've definitely watched this video at 2 A.M.

A glob of neon blue goo gets squished into a crusty car air vent. It gets pulled out, and suddenly... spotless. No dust. No crumbs. No weird sticky residue.

It's "Car Cleaning Gel," or as TikTok calls it, the "Magic Dust Slime." It triggers that oddly satisfying part of your brain that loves seeing dirt disappear.

## The Pain: The "As Seen on TV" Markup

Because it's viral, sellers on Amazon and Instagram go crazy with the pricing.

You'll see "Detailing Gel Kits" selling for $12, $15, or even $20. They market it as high-tech cleaning equipment.

Let's be real: It's slime. It's basically glue and water. Paying $15 for a tub of goop is robbery. Plus, you'll likely forget the brand name five minutes after scrolling past the video.

## The Fix: Wino Finds the Factory Price

Don't let a dropshipper charge you 10x the price for "aesthetic packaging."

1. **Share** that satisfying cleaning video to Wino.
2. **Auto-Save** it (so you don't forget to clean your car).
3. **Reveal** the factory price instantly.

We ran the search. The exact same biodegradable cleaning gel—same stickiness, same lemon scent—is on Temu and AliExpress for literally $1.89.

## The Verdict: Buy in Bulk

This is the ultimate impulse buy, but only if the price is right. It's reusable until it turns black, then you toss it.

**Amazon "Detailing Kit":** $14.99  
**Wino Factory Find:** $1.89

**The Math:** You can buy a lifetime supply of slime for the price of one Amazon jar.

**Bottom line:** Keep your cup holders crumb-free without cleaning out your bank account. Use Wino, get the $2 deal, and stay satisfied.
