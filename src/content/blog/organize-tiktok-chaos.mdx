We have all been there. You are scrolling at 2 AM, you see a cool gadget, you hit "Like," and you keep scrolling. Two weeks later, you want to buy it, but it's buried under 500 cat videos.

## The "Favorites" Trap

TikTok's Save feature is great for memes, but terrible for shopping.
*   No price tracking.
*   No direct links.
*   Links expire or products go out of stock.

## The Wino Workflow (Share to Save)

Instead of cluttering your likes, treat Wino as your **Shopping Bookshelf**.

1.  **Don't Like it, Share it:** When you see a product, tap Share -> Wino.
2.  **Forget it:** We automatically extract the image and title.
3.  **Find it later:** Open Wino next time you get paid. Your wishlist is clean, visual, and ready to buy.

## Pro Tip: Grouping
Use Wino to separate "Needs" (Tech, Tools) from "Wants" (Decor, Toys). Your wallet will thank you.
